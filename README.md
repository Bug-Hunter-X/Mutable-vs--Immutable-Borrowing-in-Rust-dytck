# Mutable vs. Immutable Borrowing in Rust

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming related to the misuse of mutable and immutable references. The provided code snippets highlight the problem and illustrate how to resolve it by careful consideration of ownership and borrowing rules.  Improper handling of mutable borrows can lead to compiler errors or unexpected program behavior.

## Bug Description

The original code attempts to use an immutable reference to a mutable vector, leading to an error. Modifying a vector through an immutable reference is not allowed in Rust due to its strict borrowing rules.  The solution refactors the code to correctly manage mutable borrowing.
